# BinaryClassification
## 	:warning: Disclaimer
This is a continuation of the [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/BryceDecker/SentimentAnalysis) project and thus our motivation has been established and the data is ready for analysis. 

## üõà Background Information
Binary classification is a machine learning technique used to categorize data into two distinct classes or categories. It has been extensively applied in various domains, including spam detection, disease diagnosis, sentiment analysis, and fraud detection. By leveraging historical data and training algorithms, binary classification models are able to make predictions and classify new instances into one of the two predefined classes with high accuracy.

## üéØ Aim
This project's focus will be on binary classification techniques to predict Lebron's response tone as either more neutral or more positive. We seek to identify models with the highest accuracy across various random states.
